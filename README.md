# NotASimpleCalculator
This is my version of a calculator application, which allows the user to calculate sum, difference, and product of two positive decimal numbers. These decimal numbers might consist of thousands of digits.

Challenges/Purposes and Plans:
-   Do not use the int basic type for any part of the program.
-   For mathematical calculation do not use any prebuild Java classes. For example, it is not allowed to use java.math. Calculations
    should be done in the same way, as someone might do them using pen and paper.
-   Create an algorithm that can be used in order to calculate sum, difference and product of two decimal numbers (which consist of             (2^15)-1 symbols).
-   Can use ArrayList Data Structure only for the multiplication part of the algorithm, for the rest use String methods.
-   Create GUI (Graphical User Interface).
-   Create mechanism to produce random decimal numbers, which are consstructed un the following way:  x numbers before/after the point.
