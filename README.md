# NotASimpleCalculator
This is my version of a calculator application, which allows the user to calculate sum, difference, and product of two decimal numbers. These decimal numbers might consist of thousands of digits.

Challenges/Purposes and Plans:
-   do not use int basic type.
-   create an algorithm that can be used in order to calculate sum, difference and product of two decimal numbers (which consist of             (2^15)-1 symbols).
-   create GUI (Graphical User Interface).
