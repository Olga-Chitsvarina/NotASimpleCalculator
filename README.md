# NotASimpleCalculator
This is my version of a calculator application, which allows the user to calculate sum, difference, and product of two positive decimal numbers. These decimal numbers might consist of thousands of digits.

Challenges/Purposes and Plans:
-   Do not use the int basic type for any part of the program.
-   For mathematical calculation do not use java.math. Calculations should be done in the same way, as someone might do them using pen and     paper.
-   Create an algorithm that can be used in order to calculate sum, difference and product of two decimal numbers (which consist of             (2^15)-1 symbols).
-   Can use ArrayList Data Structure only for the multiplication part of the algorithm, for the rest use String methods.
-   Let the user to enter not only decimal numbers, but interges too.
-   Create mechanism to produce random decimal numbers, which are constructed in the following way: x numbers before/after the point.
-   Create GUI (Graphical User Interface).
